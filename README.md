## Key features

- Run inference or fine-tune large language models like [BLOOM-176B](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom) by joining compute resources with people all over the Internet. No need to have high-end GPUs.
- It's difficult to fit the whole BLOOM-176B into GPU memory [unless](https://twitter.com/Tim_Dettmers/status/1559892918395031552) you have multiple high-end GPUs. Instead, **Petals** allows to load and serve a small part of the model, then team up with people serving all the other parts to run inference or fine-tuning.
- This way, one inference step takes â‰ˆ 1 sec â€” much faster than possible with offloading. Enough for chatbots and other interactive apps.
- Beyond traditional language model APIs â€” you can employ any fine-tuning and sampling methods by executing custom paths through the model or accessing its hidden states. This allows for the comforts of an API with the flexibility of PyTorch.

### Examples

Solving a sequence classification task via soft prompt tuning of BLOOM-176B:

```python
# Initialize distributed BLOOM with soft prompts
model = AutoModelForPromptTuning.from_pretrained(
       "bigscience/distributed-bloom")
# Define optimizer for prompts and linear head
optimizer = torch.optim.AdamW(model.parameters())

for input_ids, labels in data_loader:
    # Forward pass with local and remote layers
    outputs = model.forward(input_ids)
    loss = cross_entropy(outputs.logits, labels)

    # Distributed backward w.r.t. local params
    loss.backward() # Compute model.prompts.grad
    optimizer.step() # Update local params only
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```

### ðŸš§ This project is in active development

Be careful: some features may not work, interfaces may change, and we have no detailed docs yet (see [roadmap](https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals/issues/12)).

A stable version of the code and a public swarm open to everyone will be released in November 2022. You can [subscribe](https://petals.ml/) to be emailed when it happens or fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/TV3wtRPeHewjZ1vH9) to help the public launch by donating GPU time. In the meantime, you can launch and use your own private swarm.

### ðŸ”’ Privacy and security

If you work with sensitive data, you should only use a private swarm (or a subset of servers in the public swarm) hosted by people and institutions you trust, who are authorized to process this data.

This is important because it's technically possible for peers serving model layers to recover input data or model outputs. Also, if there are malicious peers, they may alter their outputs to influence the model outputs. See a more detailed discussion in Section 4 of our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.01188.pdf).

## FAQ

1. **What's the motivation for people to run servers hosting model layers in the public swarm?**

    People who run inference and fine-tuning themselves get a certain speedup if they host a part of the model locally. Some may be also motivated to "give back" to the community helping them to run the model (similarly to how [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) users help others by sharing data they have already downloaded).

    Since it may be not enough for everyone, we are also working on introducing explicit __incentives__ ("bloom points") for people donating their GPU time to the public swarm. Once this system is ready, people who earned these points will be able to spend them on inference/fine-tuning with higher priority or increased security guarantees, or (maybe) exchange them for other rewards.

2. **Why is the platform named "Petals"?**

    "Petals" is a metaphor for people serving different parts of the model. Together, they host the entire language model &mdash; [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/bigscience/bloom).

    While our platform focuses on BLOOM now, we aim to support more [foundation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.07258) in future.

## Installation

```bash
conda install -y -c conda-forge cudatoolkit-dev==11.3.1 cudatoolkit==11.3.1 cudnn==8.2.1.32
pip install torch==1.12.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ bitsandbytes-cuda113
```

### Basic functionality

All tests is run on localhost

First, run one or more servers like this:
```bash
# minimalistic server with non-trained bloom blocks
python -m cli.run_server --converted_model_name_or_path bigscience/test-bloomd-6b3 \
  --block_indices 3:5 --torch_dtype float32 --identity_path ./server1.id --host_maddrs /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/31337
# when running multiple servers:
# - give each server a unique --identity_path (or remote --identity_path arg when debugging)
# - if running multiple servers on the same machine, give each a unique port (last integer in --host_maddrs, 0 means random port)
# - when running over the internet, change --host_maddrs according to https://learning-at-home.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/dht.html#running-across-the-internet
# - each server except first should have --initial_peers pointing to one of pre-existing servers
```

Then open a python notebook or console and run:
```python
import torch
import hivemind
from src import DistributedBloomConfig, get_remote_module


dht = hivemind.DHT(
    initial_peers=[TODO_COPY_FULL_ADDRESS_FROM_ANY_OF_THE_SERVERS],  # e.g. /ip4/127.0.0.1/...
    client_mode=True, start=True,
)
config = DistributedBloomConfig.from_pretrained("bigscience/test-bloom-6b3")
layer3, layer4 = get_remote_module(dht, ['bigscience/test-bloomd-6b3.3', 'bigscience/test-bloomd-6b3.4'], config)
assert layer3 is not None and layer4 is not None, "one or both layers were not found in DHT"
# test forward/backward, two blocks
outputs = layer4(layer3(torch.randn(1, 64, 4096)))
loss = (outputs * torch.randn_like(outputs)).norm()
loss.backward()

# test inference, one block
with layer3.inference_session(max_length=10) as sess:
    for i in range(10):
        res = sess.step(torch.ones(1, 1, 4096))
```


### Convert regular BLOOM into distributed
```bash

# convert model from HF hub to a distributed format (can take hours depending on your connection!)
MY_WRITE_TOKEN=TODO_WRITE_TOKEN_FROM_https://huggingface.co/settings/token
python -m cli.convert_model --model bigscience/bloom-6b3  \
  --output_path ./converted_model --output_repo bigscience/test-bloomd-6b3 \
  --use_auth_token $MY_WRITE_TOKEN  # ^-- todo replace output repo with something you have access to
```


### Test local vs remote block (allclose)

To test distributed inference, run one or more servers, then open a new shell and run pytest with environment variables:
```bash
# shell A: serve model
python -m cli.run_server --converted_model_name_or_path bigscience/test-bloomd-6b3 \
  --torch_dtype float32 --identity_path ./server1.id --host_maddrs /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/31337

# shell B:
export PYTHONPATH=.
export INITIAL_PEERS="/ip4/TODO_COPY_INITIAL_PEERS_FROM_SERVER_OUTPUT"
export MODEL_NAME="bigscience/test-bloomd-6b3"

# test individual random blocks for exact match
pytest tests/test_block_exact_match.py

# test the full model
pytest tests/test_full_model.py
```
